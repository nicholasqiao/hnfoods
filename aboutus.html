        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>H&N Foods International could have easily capsized from the start if it hadn’t been for the innovation and optimism of one man. Originally founded as H&N Fish Co. by Hua Ngo in 1981, H&N Foods International started quite humbly with an immigrant and a fishing boat. Mr. Ngo intended to be a commercial fisherman until an unfortunate series of events jeopardized his livelihood leaving him with a fishing boat that was no longer seaworthy. In true entrepreneurial fashion, Mr. Ngo turned the obstacle into an opportunity by purchasing a van and forging relationships with independent fisherman in San Francisco to sell and distribute their catches of the day. Hauling vanloads of fresh fish and seafood, Mr. Ngo began to establish similar relationships with the small business owners of local markets and restaurants in places like Chinatown and throughout the city.</p>

        <p>Some twenty-four years later, Mr. Ngo remains actively involved in the day-to-day operations of H&N Foods International. Through the years, he has managed to build relationships with many of the leading seafood producers around the world with the same levels of loyalty and respect. Partnerships in North America, Central America, South America, the Pacific Rim, Europe and Australia have enabled H&N Foods to supply and wholesale one of the industry’s most extensive and diverse lines of fresh fish, live fish and frozen seafood as well as 5 distinct packaged brands.</p>

        <p>Today, H&N Foods International has evolved from one man driving back and forth locally in San Francisco to a dedicated team of over 150 employees working tirelessly with customers all over the world. With four HACCP-qualified locations on the West Coast and investments in global logistics and new technology, the company continues to meet the growing demands of its national and international customers without sacrificing its commitment to quality and dependability—attributes that solidified H&N Foods during its formative years. Ever cognizant of its entrepreneurial roots, H&N Foods takes pride in creating new business relationships whether they are with large corporations or small businesses. Additionally, H&N Foods keeps strong community ties as an active supporter of oceanic preservation institutes such as the California Academy of Sciences and Ocean Trust. As an importer, wholesaler, distributor and processor, H&N Foods actively seeks out new sources for fine seafood products and remains dedicated to providing all of its customers with extensive selections, professional service and premium quality seafood.</p>
